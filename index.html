      <h2>Moderna to apply today for FDA authorization for its Covid-19 vaccine</h2>
      <h4>Updated 8:00 AM ET, Mon November 30, 2020</h4>
      <h5><a href="http://lite.cnn.com/en/article/h_8a9d29406e73343797dbac1d4a23586c" target="_blank">view source</a></h5>
      <p>(CNN) - Pharmaceutical company Moderna intends to apply Monday to the US Food and Drug Administration for authorization of its Covid-19 vaccine.</p>
      <p>The company will ask the FDA to review an expanded data set showing the vaccine is 94.1% effective at preventing Covid-19 and 100% effective at preventing severe cases of the disease.</p>
      <p>"This is striking," said Dr. Paul Offit, a member of the FDA's vaccine advisory committee. "These are amazing data."</p>
      <p>Moderna's chief medical officer said he became emotional when he saw the data Saturday night.</p>
      <p>"It was the first time I allowed myself to cry," Dr. Tal Zaks said. "We have a full expectation to change the course of this pandemic."</p>
      <p>Moderna will become the second company to apply to the FDA for emergency use authorization for a coronavirus vaccine. Pfizer applied on November 20 with data showing similarly high efficacy.</p>
      <p>The FDA will meet with its advisory committee in December to review Pfizer's and Moderna's applications.</p>
      <p>The first vaccinations in the United States are expected to take place "towards the latter part of December," according to Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.</p>
      <p>Moderna's new data</p>
      <p>On Monday, Moderna released updated efficacy data for its Phase 3 clinical trial.</p>
      <p>Starting in July, Moderna gave either its vaccine or a placebo -- a shot of saline that does nothing -- to some 30,000 people in the United States. With high rates of coronavirus throughout the country over the next following months, many of those study subjects developed Covid-19.</p>
      <p>But there was a big difference between the group that got the vaccine and the group that got the placebo.</p>
      <p>Among the approximately 15,000 people who received the vaccine, 11 developed Covid-19.</p>

    <h2>Coronavirus Is Surging: How Severe Is Your State's Outbreak?</h2>
    <h3>By Stephanie Adeline, Connie Hanzhang Jin, Alyson Hurt, Thomas Wilburn, Daniel Wood, Ruth Talbot</h3>

    <p>More than 13 million people in the U.S. have had confirmed coronavirus infections and more than 250,000 have died of COVID-19. Tens of thousands of new cases are reported daily nationwide. In the graphics below, explore the trends in your state.</p>
    <p>View the data via a heat map (immediately below), curve charts, a table of state-by-state trends over four weeks, or a map of total cases and deaths.</p>
    <p>The map above shows the risk of infection in each state based on new daily cases per capita. The consortium of researchers and public health experts who developed these risk levels advises states in the red category to issue stay-home orders. They advise orange states to consider stay-home orders, along with increased testing and contact tracing. Yellow states need to keep up social distancing and mask usage, and all states should continue testing and contact tracing.</p>
    <p>To compare state outbreaks, the chart above graphs trend lines for average new daily cases and deaths against each state's totals to date. This type of visualization highlights a state's daily growth or decline relative to the overall size of its outbreak.</p>
    <p>When both new and total case and death counts grow quickly, the curves bend upward. As new cases and deaths slow, the curves level or bend down. In New York, the curve rose sharply before reaching over 170,000 total cases in April. New cases fell from about 10,000 per day in mid-April to under 900 a day most of the summer, before starting to rise in the fall.</p>
    <p>Explore the map above to see totals and per capita figures around the country for both new confirmed cases and reported deaths from COVID-19. New York was the original epicenter of the pandemic in the U.S. As of mid October, California, Florida and Texas surpass New York for total cases to date, though New York still has the highest death total.</p>

    <p>To show trends, the table below shows the change in average new cases per day in each state, week over week for the last 28 days. States marked in shades of red have growing outbreaks; those in shades of green, are declining.</p>
    <p>Methodology</p>
    <p>The graphics on this page pull from data compiled by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering at Johns Hopkins University from several sources, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; the World Health Organization; national, state and local government health departments; 1point3acres; and local media reports.</p>
    <p>The JHU team automates its data uploads and regularly checks them for anomalies. This may result in occasional data discrepancies on this page as the JHU team resolves anomalies and updates its feeds. State-by-state recovery data are unavailable at this time. There may be discrepancies between what you see here and what you see on your local health department's website. Figures shown do not include cases on cruise ships.</p>
    <p>Fluctuations in the numbers may happen as health authorities review old cases and or update their methodologies. For example, in early June, Michigan health authorities started including probable cases in its totals. This resulted in a brief spike in the state's daily numbers until the JHU team was able to reconcile the historical data. On June 25, New Jersey included 1,854 previously-unreported probable deaths in its totals, resulting in a spike in the state's daily death numbers. On Sept. 2, Massachusetts changed its methodology for counting probable cases, which lowered its overall case and death numbers. The JHU team maintains a list of such changes.</p>

    <h2>So You Traveled Over Thanksgiving. Now What?</h2>
    <h3>By Laurel Wamsley</h3>
    <h4>Monday, November 30, 2020 • 6:22 PM EST</h4>
    <h5><a href="https://text.npr.org/940190370" target="_blank">view source</a></h5>
    <p>Despite the repeated warnings of public health experts and officials, millions of people traveled for Thanksgiving.</p>
    <p>Perhaps you're one of them.</p>
    <p>So what should you do now to keep from creating the "surge upon a surge" of coronavirus cases that Dr. Anthony Fauci is warning the U.S. could soon face?</p>
    <p>"You have to assume you were exposed and you became infected"</p>
    <p>Dr. Deborah Birx, the coordinator of the White House's coronavirus task force, has this advice: Assume you picked up the virus.</p>
    <p>"If your family traveled, you have to assume you were exposed and you became infected, and you really need to get tested in the next week, and you need to avoid anyone in your family with comorbidities or are over 65," she told CBS' Face the Nation on Sunday.</p>
    <p>She recommends masking indoors if people in your household traveled or gathered with others for Thanksgiving. "If you're young and you gathered," Birx says, "you need to assume that you're infected and not go near your grandparents and aunts and others without a mask."</p>
    <p>If you're over 65 or have comorbidities and you gathered at Thanksgiving, watch out for symptoms.</p>
    <p>"If you develop any symptoms, you need be tested immediately because we know that our therapeutics work best — both our antivirals and our monoclonal antibodies — work best very early in disease," Birx says.</p>
    <p>Adm. Brett Giroir, a physician who oversees the federal government's testing response, says you need to be extra-careful as you return home — though he says you don't necessarily need to do a strict two-week quarantine.</p>
    <p>"Just remember you've had an increased risk of being exposed," he told CNN. "So you should decrease unnecessary activities for about a week. And if you can get tested in three or five days, that's also a very good idea."</p>

    <p>This is the time to be extra-careful, wear masks and avoid crowds, because of the increased risk that you might have gotten the coronavirus — and you could spread it.</p>
    <p>"There certainly can be a surge because of the travel and the mixing of people who have not been in their own little pods," he said, calling this "a risky time."</p>
    <p>What happens next depends on the precautions that people take now, Giroir said.</p>
    <p>"We're very concerned about the travel, but what we do makes a difference. It's not as if we're passive onlookers," he said. "We could really make a difference here."</p>
    <p>Birx agrees: "What happened happened. I mean, we know that people got together in Thanksgiving. The moment now is to protect those from having secondary and tertiary transmissions within the family."</p>
    <p>What do other experts say?</p>
    <p>Abraar Karan is an internal medicine doctor at the Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School.</p>
    <p>His advice is that those returning from travel but who don't have a known coronavirus exposure should quarantine for the next seven to 10 days. If they have a known exposure, they should quarantine for two weeks.</p>
    <p>Why does he recommend a quarantine for all who traveled? Because of the high levels of viral transmission around the U.S. right now, including by people who are asymptomatic.</p>
    <p>"[P]eople will be exposed to others who are infectious but not showing any symptoms. So in many cases, they won't even know that they had an exposure," he wrote by email to NPR. "Many people are saying they have no idea where they were infected."</p>
    <p>He recommends getting tested twice: ideally when you first return home and then again three to five days later.</p>
    <p>"This will notably increase the chance that you detect the virus over a longer incubation period," he says.</p>

    <p>And Karan emphasizes that it's important to do the quarantine right. "Quarantining doesn't mean walking around your house or apartment as if you're healthy. It means staying in your room and avoiding contact with other people as if you were infected. It means wearing a mask when you leave your room if you need to do that."</p>
    <p>Keep in mind that different states have different rules for returning travelers, so check to see what is required where you live. The requirements may depend on where you traveled.</p>
    <p>When will we know how much the virus spread over Thanksgiving?</p>
    <p>The incubation period for the virus is two to 14 days, and people who get the virus generally develop symptoms five to six days after exposure.</p>
    <p>"If there was a lot of spread around Thanksgiving, we'll be seeing that around a week or two or three into December and onward," Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told NPR's Allison Aubrey.</p>
    <p>"Unfortunately, we have far too much spread in the United States, and because of that, December is likely to be a hard month," Frieden warns.</p>
    <p>And if you do test positive for the virus?</p>
    <p>Be sure to share that information with those you spent time with over the holiday weekend. If you want to protect your loved ones, they need to know they might have been exposed.</p>

    <h2>Covid-19 is a 'split screen' scenario heading into 2021. Here's how the news media should cover it</h2>
    <h4>Updated 12:40 AM ET, Tue December 1, 2020</h4>
    <h5><a href="http://lite.cnn.com/en/article/h_a15e4ca5091a490ee3ab25d85f31c943" target="_blank">view source</a></h5>
    <p>(CNN Business) - A version of this article first appeared in the "Reliable Sources" newsletter. You can sign up for free right here.</p>
    <p>The days are getting shorter. The lines for Covid-19 testing are getting longer. The case counts are getting scarier and the warnings from public health experts are getting more and more dire.</p>
    <p>At the same time, the prospects for publicly available vaccines are looking better and better. So how should the news media balance the bleak Covid winter with the hopeful news about all the help that's on the way? I asked several experts on Monday and came away with valuable insights.</p>
    <p>"Realism is important," University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill professor Zeynep Tufekci told me. "The good news is really good, but that doesn't take away from the challenges we still face and the tough winter ahead with surging cases across the nation, overloaded hospitals and overworked health-care workers. So I think it's a matter of being realistic on both counts, the good and the bad."</p>
    <p>Tufekci has authored several acclaimed pieces about the pandemic this year. Her latest, on Monday, was about the "pandemic heroes who gave us the gift of time and gift of information," helping companies to develop vaccines in record time. Speaking of the vaccines.</p>
    <p>The 2021 "split screen"</p>
    <p>"If 2020 was one long episode of misery, 2021 will be a split screen," Juliette Kayyemsaid. Kayyem is a homeland security expert, a lecturer at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government and a CNN analyst. She said "reporters must continue to expose the tragedy of this pandemic and our government's response, but also capture the glimmering light -- that will be brighter over the months as this distribution rolls across the US, delivering a vaccine in waves -- that will get us to normalish."</p>
    <p>Kayyem also made the point that "medical stories -- of patients and doctors and the health apparatus -- are so personal, intimate. Supply chain logistics are not." So the story is changing: "We are now pivoting to a story whose success is measured in bulk; it will be messy, and big, and bulky, and rolling over a long time period. These stories are only interesting when something goes wrong: a missed delivery, a power outage that impacts freezing capacity, a person getting a vaccine who shouldn't yet or one who can't. So, it's worth taking a step back and assessing just how much is getting done -- measured in its totality."</p>
    <p>While the vaccines are rolling out, millions of Americans will still be getting sick. "We have to make it through the next two months," said emergency physician and Brown University professor Dr. Megan Ranney, a relatively new addition to CNN's group of medical analysts. "We have to keep hammering home the message that this is a real disease, and there are real things that we can do to prevent the spread."</p>
    <p>"You as the media," Ranney said on the phone, "are our best chance of giving a comprehensible and consistent public health message, since our federal government continues to fall down on the job and many state governments continue to fall down on the job."</p>
    <p>"The road ahead is bound to be tortuous"</p>
    <p>"Covid-19 has never been a one-dimensional story," STAT News co-founder and executive editor Rick Berke pointed out. "For many months, we've seen gradual scientific progress on vaccines and therapeutics even as we've witnessed human tragedy at a breathtaking scale. Journalists have faithfully covered both the hope and the despair."</p>
    <p>"In that respect," Berke wrote in an email, "news organizations have a responsibility this winter to keep doing what they have since the start of this crisis — cover all elements of the story. Find ways to tell compelling human stories so that the public doesn't lose sight of the incredible toll Covid-19 is taking on the country. And find ways to reflect the promise of vaccines, while rigorously reporting on their rollout. These vaccines are real lights at the end of the tunnel, but they are not panaceas. There are pressing questions about the vaccines themselves, such as how long they will provide immunity, as well as about how they will be distributed and who will get them first."</p>
    <p>Berke raised some key questions -- ones that news outlets need to keep addressing. Readers and viewers need answers to basic inquiries about the vaccines. "The road ahead is bound to be tortuous," he said, "and it's one journalists need to follow."</p>
    <p>Another day of record hospitalizations</p>
    <p>This just in from CNN Health's Ben Tinker: "A record 96,039 people in the United States are currently hospitalized with Covid-19, according to data published Monday evening by The COVID Tracking Project. This is the third straight day of new record numbers, following a slight dip reported on Friday. The states with the most people currently hospitalized with Covid-19 are Texas, California, Illinois, Ohio and Pennsylvania."</p>
    <p>Read CNN's latest overview story here.</p>
    <p>But "we can see the shoreline"</p>
    <p>There's just an awful amount of infection rippling through the United States. The NYT's in-house expert, Donald G. McNeil Jr., is out with a new story titled "The Long Darkness Before Dawn," noting that "the number of deaths is rising and seems on track to easily surpass the 2,200-a-day average in the spring, when the pandemic was concentrated in the New York metropolitan area." McNeil says "our failure to protect ourselves has caught up to us."</p>
    <p>But his story also describes his "hopeful" view of 2021, thanks to the vaccines on the horizon. Kayyem sounded similarly hopeful -- she told me she was born cautious, but is feeling truly optimistic right now. "As reporters and analysts, I think we can allow ourselves to be," she said. "It's like with sea sickness; the misery seems easier if we can see the shoreline. We can see it." She has even booked a vacation — for this coming August.</p>
    <p>The need for leadership</p>
    <p>On Monday CNN's Stephen Collinson wrote about a "leaderless America" slipping deep into the Covid winter. President Trump's negligence is only part of the story. Some governors have also been in hiding.</p>
    <p>I noted on Sunday's "Reliable Sources" that Florida governor Ron DeSantis was refusing to hold press briefings and relying on video messages about Covid-19 instead. On Monday, for what it's worth, he DID hold a Covid briefing for the first time in four weeks. The first question was posed by a reporter who asked, "Where have you been?" CNN's research found that 14 other governors have only held a single Covid-19 press briefing apiece in the month of November. A majority of the governors are Republicans. These men and women need to be front and center right now!</p>
    <p>We'll never know...</p>
    <p>I was struck by something that Surgeon General Dr. Jerome Adams said to Bret Baier on "Fox News Sunday." There are "many different things that we could have done differently," Adams said. "This virus has been challenging. I wish that again this hadn't been superimposed on top of an election. I wish that we had been able to come together as a nation and really talk about the science instead of the politics, and that's on all sides, that's all around." The "all sides" comment is a cop-out, but he's right about the terrible timing of this tragedy. We'll never know how different it could have been.</p>

    <h2>Alligators can regrow their tails, new study finds</h2>
    <h4>Updated 9:45 PM ET, Mon November 30, 2020</h4>
    <h5><a href="http://lite.cnn.com/en/article/h_f6891874651fafd9df24466fef263629" target="_blank">view source</a></h5>
    <p>(CNN) - Small reptiles like lizards and geckos are known for their extraordinary ability to regrow their tails, a potentially lifesaving skill in the wild. But it turns out these reptiles are not the only animals in the amniote family with the ability to regenerate appendages.</p>
    <p>Researchers were surprised to discover that juvenile alligators also have the ability to regrow their tails up to 9 inches, or up to 18% of their total body length, according to a new study in Scientific Reports.</p>
    <p>A team of scientists from Arizona State University and the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries used advanced imaging techniques together with time-tested methods of studying anatomy and tissue organization to find that the alligators' regrown tails had a central cartilage skeleton without any bone, exhibiting features of both regeneration and wound repair.</p>
    <p>"The regrown skeleton was surrounded by connective tissue and skin but lacked any skeletal muscle (which lizard tails do regenerate with)," Kenro Kusumi, co-senior study author and professor and director of ASU's School of Life Sciences and associate dean in the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, told CNN.</p>
    <p>Even a muscle-less regrown tail is vital for the massive predators, Kusumi added.</p>
    <p>The team of researchers says that understanding these limitations may help in developing regenerative therapies in humans.</p>
    <p>"We know that humans -- who are incapable of regenerating -- have the same cells and pathways being used to regenerate in these other animals," Jeanne Wilson-Rawls, co-senior study author and associate professor with ASU's School of Life Sciences, told CNN.</p>
    <p>"If this very large long-limbed animal has this ability, can we take advantage of this to help people who have lost limbs or burn victims who need skin regeneration?"</p>
    <p>Kusumi quickly added that this isn't something that is going to happen tomorrow, but maybe by the end of the century.</p>
